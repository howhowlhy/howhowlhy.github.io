This is a web demo for FinHack 2018 - Fintech Hackathon.

Our team created an all-in-one platform showcasing individuals 
MPF (Mandatory Provident Fund in Hong Kong) accounts performance 
and consolidation suggestions.

I was the front-end developer and I developed this web-based prototype.

This website was initially hosted on Azure, unfortunately I used up all my credits,
so I moved the whole website here instead LOL.
