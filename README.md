# MPF-hero
MPFHero - a web demo for FinHack 2018 - Fintech Hackathon

Our team created an all-in-one platform (MPFHero) showcasing individuals 
MPF (Mandatory Provident Fund in Hong Kong) accounts performance 
and consolidation suggestions.

I was the front-end developer and I built this web-based demo for demonstration purpose.

The website was initially hosted on Azure, unfortunately I used up all my credits,
so I moved the whole website here instead LOL.
